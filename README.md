# D-Flip-Flop-on-Xilinx-Vivado
The repository provides Verilog code for a D Flip Flop, including a comprehensive testbench for verifying sequential circuit behavior using the Vivado Simulator. The D Flip Flop module features input signals for data (D), clock (clk), and reset, with an output signal (Q) that updates based on the clock's rising edge or the reset signal. The provided truth table outlines the expected behavior for various input conditions. The testbench applies these sequences to verify functionality, as shown in the waveform simulation, which illustrates the correct timing and state transitions of the D Flip Flop. This project is ideal for understanding and implementing basic sequential circuits in Xilinx Vivado, offering both the design and simulation tools necessary for effective analysis.
